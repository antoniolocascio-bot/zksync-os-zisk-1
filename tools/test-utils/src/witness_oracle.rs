//! Witness-soundness testing: does the guest VERIFY its witness?
//!
//! The native cross-check answers whether the guest executes an honest witness
//! the way native ZKsync OS does. This answers the other question: for a
//! mutated witness of the SAME statement, does the guest either reject it, or
//! commit the honest value? A mutation the guest accepts and commits
//! differently is two witnesses for one statement, which is a soundness
//! defect. See `docs/witness-soundness-testing.md`.
