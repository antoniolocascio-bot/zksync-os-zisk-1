# Committed EEST native-reference corpus

This directory contains content-addressed ZKsync OS state dumps generated from
EEST v5.4.0. Each dump carries the complete witness plus the commitments emitted
by native ZKsync OS. Pull-request CI rebuilds `dump_to_batchinput` from the
candidate branch and checks every unique dump against those native references.

The corpus is sharded by EEST family. `manifest.json` pins the fixture version,
the state-dump producer commit, source and deduplicated case counts, compressed
sizes, and SHA-256 for every archive. A case file is named by the SHA-256 of its
canonical JSON. Object keys and semantically unordered witness collections are
sorted, removing superficial serialization ordering. Case identity derives
from the canonical payload rather than the producer's parallel case counter.
`skipped_filters` records fixture families the pinned producer cannot parse or
execute, so the committed coverage boundary stays explicit.

The per-PR corpus covers the established 35-family baseline.
`static/state_tests` is listed as excluded because its native producer includes
pathological long-running cases; it remains a separate resource-bounded run.
This baseline targets protocol minor 31. It does not represent the
AtlasV4/Osaka corpus exercised by `matter-labs/zksync-os-zisk#6`; rotate it
after that work lands.

Run the committed gate locally:

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path tools/test-utils/Cargo.toml \
  --bin dump_to_batchinput
tools/run-eest-native.py \
  --reader tools/test-utils/target/release/dump_to_batchinput \
  --output /tmp/zisk-eest-native
```

Regeneration needs a dedicated checkout of
`antoniolocascio-bot/zksync-os` at branch
`zisk/state-dump-hook-v030` and the commit recorded in the generator, plus the
official EEST v5.4.0 stable and develop fixtures. That producer commit is not
reachable from a branch or tag in `matter-labs/zksync-os`. Keep the fork
attribution until its `evm_tester_prod` rig alignment lands there; without the
fork ref, regeneration is blocked.

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/fresh-target \
CORPUS_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/large-temporary-directory \
tools/generate-eest-corpus.sh \
  /path/to/dedicated-zksync-os-checkout \
  /path/to/ethereum-fixtures \
  /path/to/empty-corpus-output
```

Regenerate only when the native protocol reference or fixture release changes.
Review manifest counts and hashes, run the full native gate, and land the corpus
rotation together with any required waiver changes. Target-specific ZiSK ABI and
crypto-hook coverage remains in the separate `ziskemu` lane.

The native producer can assign equivalent internal witness layouts in different
orders across executions. Canonicalization removes output-order differences but
does not rewrite tree indices or other semantic witness fields. Treat regenerated
shard and dedup-count changes as reviewable data changes; the manifest and
content-addressed filenames make the exact committed baseline unambiguous.
